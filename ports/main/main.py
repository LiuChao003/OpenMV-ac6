# Face Detection Example
#
# This example shows off the built-in face detection feature of the OpenMV Cam.
#
# Face detection works by using the Haar Cascade feature detector on an image. A
# Haar Cascade is a series of simple area contrasts checks. For the built-in
# frontalface detector there are 25 stages of checks with each stage having
# hundreds of checks a piece. Haar Cascades run fast because later stages are
# only evaluated if previous stages pass. Additionally, your OpenMV Cam uses
# a data structure called the integral image to quickly execute each area
# contrast check in constant time (the reason for feature detection being
# grayscale only is because of the space requirment for the integral image).

    # Note: Actual FPS is higher, streaming the FB makes it slower.
